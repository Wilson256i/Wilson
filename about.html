       Welcome to my website! My name is Businge Wilson, and I am a cybersecurity technician with a passion for coding. I developed a love for coding when I was only 16 years old, and since then, I have been honing my skills and knowledge in this field.
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
As a curious and eager learner, I enrolled myself in an online codebase, where I gained extensive knowledge and skills in various programming languages, such as C++, Python, Java, and Ruby. This enabled me to build various applications and websites, and I even won some coding competitions.

I understood the importance of having a secure online environment, and I trained myself in ethical hacking, networking, and cybersecurity. With my expertise in coding and cybersecurity, I became a cybersecurity technician and have been working on various projects to ensure online safety.</p>
